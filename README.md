# Flavour Fusion

## Description
Our website Flavour Fusion is inspired by our group's mutual love for food and cooking. The purpose is to give users an easy way to search for recipes with an option for Vegans to easily sift through recipes that fit their needs.

## Usage
It is utilized by entering recipes you're looking for, with an auto-complete feature that suggests recipes with the characters you enter into the interactive search bar. There is also an option to view a list of only Vegan-friendly recipes at the click of a button using an API. 
After selecting a recipe, the page will display a title, photo, ingredients needed, instructions, as well as a sidebar with previously searched recipes.
The homepage will display previously viewed recipes by pulling them from local storage. For accessibility, we have a "Toggle Instructions" button to give the user clarification on how to use our website. A "clear history" button is also available. Log in and account creation functionality is added along with an option to submit your own recipe to the database.

## Technology
HTML, CSS, JavaScript are utilized along with Bootstrap and jQuery. We used two APIs in our website -- Recipe with images API and The Vegan Recipes API.
